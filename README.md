# GitChinaLab Design
Here is the place to chat about and develop GitChinaLab's visual identity and assets. If you have a question about that or
noticed something odd, feel free to open an Issue in this repository.

GitChinaLab is all about free and open content and software, so if you want to use any of the resources here, you can do
so using the [Creative Commons CC0 license](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Do keep in mind though
that the GitChinaLab logo and other branding assets might be subject to trademark protection, which means that you can use
them in GitChinaLab-related projects or to refer to and endorse GitChinaLab, but things like stealing our Logo for your new
startup idea is something we don't like to see.

## How to use our Design
The GitChinaLab Design endorses the [Halfmoon CSS](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/) framework and
[Vue.js 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/), and many of the resources found in this repository work with them.

For more information on how to use the GitChinaLab Design assets, components & framework, and how to integrate them into
existing applications and websites, please refer to this repository's
[Wiki](https://GitChinaLab.org/GitChinaLab/Design/wiki/_pages), or have a look at
[design.GitChinaLab.org](https://design.GitChinaLab.org) if you directly want to link to the resources here.
